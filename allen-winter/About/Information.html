				 <h3>Who is Allen Winter?</h3>
				 <p> I'm a Japanese-American who is born, raised and resides in Long Island, NY. I discovered a love and courage for acting after watching Broadway shows and joining a school play in the 5th Grade. Once the acting bug hit, throughout my entire school life and in college I continued to learn more about acting and singing.</p>
				 <p> In the Summer of 2015 after I had just graduated, I decided to focus more on Voice Acting and found the right instructors to help me along the way.  Since making that choice have been a working voice actor appearing in projects ranging from video games, visual novels, audio dramas, animations and anime.</p> 
				 <p>Head over to the resume page for a full list of my projects. I also still perform on the stage, but more casually.</p>
				 <p> Outside of acting, I'm currently in the process of taking a degree in Computer Information Systems.  I enjoy most nerdy things you can think of, animation/anime, dogs, watching baseball and hockey and traveling.</p>
